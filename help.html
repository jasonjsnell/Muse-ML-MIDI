    <h1>Getting Started</h1>

        <h2>Connecting Your Browser to Ableton</h2>
        <p><a href="https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/articles/209774225-Setting-up-a-virtual-MIDI-bus"
                target="_blank">Follow these instructions</a> to connect your browser to Ableton (or another DAW).</p>
        <p>You must use Chrome or <a href="https://caniuse.com/web-bluetooth" target="_blank">another browser</a> that
            has Web Bluetooth.</p>

        <h2>MIDI Mapping in Ableton</h2>
        <p><a href="https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000038859-Making-custom-MIDI-Mappings"
                target="_blank">Follow these instructions</a> to map the brainwave MIDI CC's to music parameters inside
            Ableton. Instead of turning a knob on a MIDI controller, you'll press the "Map" button next to a State. That
            will send a single MIDI CC command over to Ableton, which can receive it if it's in MIDI Map Mode.</p>
        <p>IMPORTANT: If the Muse headset is connected and streaming data, it's nearly impossible to do MIDI mapping
            because Ableton will be trying to map several MIDI CC streams simultaneously. It's much easier to do if the
            headband is off and you press the Map buttons.</p>

        <h2>Connecting to the Muse headset</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Turn on the Muse headset</li>
            <li>Open the <a href="index.html">creator tool</a> in your browser</li>
            <li>Press the "Connect" button. A Web Bluetooth window will open.</li>
            <li>Wait for your Muse to show up in the window. Select it and click "Pair."</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Your brainwave (and with the Muse 2, your heartbeat) data will start to stream in. The numbers in the grey
            box will change and you'll see a white line showing your brainwave frequency spectrum, ranging from Delta on
            the left to Gamma on the right.</p>

        <h2>EEG Streaming Data</h2>
        <p>The incoming data stream from the EEG headset is analyzed by ML5 (machine learning) and assessed. The
            incoming signal could be determined to be:</p>
        <h3>Noise</h3>
        <p>This is when the headband is not on someone's head, or the connection is loose. I usually use this MIDI CC to
            pull down the volumes of the sounds so the atmospheric electricity isn't sonified. I only want to have music
            output when someone has the headset on with a good fit.</p>
        <h3>Muscle Tension</h3>
        <p>This category includes tension in the forehead, jaw clenches, eye blinks. The Muse headset can acts as an EMG
            (electromyography = muscle) as well as an EEG, and the biometric data of a person's muscle tension can be
            turned into a sound.</p>
        <h3>Relaxed focus</h3>
        <p>This is a new training via ML. I've found this state activates when my face is still and I'm reading or
            focusing on something, like reading text on my computer screen.</p>
        <h3>Clear mind</h3>
        <p>When I unfocus my eyes and blank out my mind, all the electrical activity of all the brainwaves drops, and
            this state is detected.</p>
        <h3>Meditative mind</h3>
        <p>The Muse headset is particularly good at detecting elevated alpha, which usually indicates the eyes are
            closed and the mind is becoming quiet.</p>
        <h3>Dreaming</h3>
        <p>If very tired, or meditating long enough that you start to have dream flashes, this state activates.</p>

        <h3>Dominant State</h3>
        <p>The state that the ML determines is the dominant state will have an arrow pointing at it. For example:</p>
        <p> > CLEAR</p>

        <h3>Biometric Data</h3>
        <p>Below the ML states are readouts of the 5 brainwaves, your heart BPM (if you're using the Muse 2 or later) and accelerometer / movement data.</p>

    <h2>MIDI Controls</h2>
    <p>Each mental state (like "Clear Mind" or "Focused") has MIDI control options for both <strong>CC (Continuous Control)</strong> and <strong>Notes</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Note Toggle</h3>
    <p>Checking the <em>Note</em> box enables MIDI note output when that state becomes dominant. This can be used to trigger samples, start loops, or play instruments.</p>

    <h3>Note Map Button</h3>
    <p>Clicking the <strong>Map</strong> button next to a Note will send a one-time MIDI note signal. Use this to map a state to a sampler or clip in your DAW (like Ableton).</p>

    <h3>CC Stream Toggle</h3>
    <p>Checking the <em>CC</em> box starts a continuous stream of MIDI CC values (0â€“127) based on how active that state is. These streams can modulate parameters like filter cutoff, reverb amount, or visual effects.</p>

    <h3>CC Map Button</h3>
    <p>Clicking the <strong>Map</strong> button next to a CC sends a single CC value (based on the current brain state) to your DAW. This makes it easy to MIDI map without overwhelming the DAW with a full data stream.</p>

    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Disable streaming before mapping, or remove the headset temporarily, so only one MIDI signal is sent during mapping.</p>
